1. **Regulatory and Supervisory Standards**: The EU has implemented measures to regulate hedge funds and private equity, increase the quality and quantity of prudential capital, address liquidity risk, and limit excessive leverage. These efforts aim to rebuild confidence among investors, consumers, and SMEs, and to harmonize sanctions to prevent market abuse.

2. **European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)**: This regulation focuses on the oversight of OTC derivatives in the EU. It includes trade reporting, central clearing, and capital requirements for non-centrally cleared trades. The European Central Bank (ECB) has identified ongoing challenges in making OTC derivatives markets more transparent and resilient, particularly in trade reporting and the use of central counterparties (CCPs).

3. **Amendments to EMIR**: In response to emerging challenges, including the UK's planned withdrawal from the EU, the European Commission proposed amendments to EMIR. These amendments aim to ensure more consistent and robust supervision of CCPs and address issues related to collateral, positions, and the recognition of third-country CCPs.

4. **Legislation on Collateralisation and Capital Charges**: The EU plans to propose legislation mandating the clearing of standardized derivatives through CCPs, along with requirements for collateralization (posting initial and variation margins) and higher capital charges under the Capital Requirements Directive.

5. **Trade Repositories**: The Commission intends to propose legislation governing trade repositories to enhance transparency in the derivatives market.

Overall, these legislative efforts are part of a broader strategy to drive European recovery, promote a low-carbon economy, and ensure the free movement of goods, services, and workers within the EU.",thumbs_down,"response is correct, but could be formatted better"
