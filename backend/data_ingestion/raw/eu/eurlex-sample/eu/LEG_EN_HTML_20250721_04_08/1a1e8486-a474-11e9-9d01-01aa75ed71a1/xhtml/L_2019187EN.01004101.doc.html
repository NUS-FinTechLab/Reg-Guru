Effects observed in fish are irreversible and may be relevant for wildlife populations. The majority of the MSC was of the opinion that, on the basis of the available information, it appears difficult to derive a safe level of exposure to adequately assess the risks although it may exist. The Commission concurs with that assessment. The Commission therefore considers that the level of concern of the adverse effects is equivalent to those of substances referred to in points (a) to (e) of Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. The fact that the adverse effects on the sexual development of fish were observed in the key study at low concentration levels (lowest observed effect concentration: 1 μg/l) further strengthens the concern.</p>
