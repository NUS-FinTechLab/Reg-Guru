   <p class="stitle-article-norm">Procedure to deal at national level with construction products presenting a risk</p>
   <p class="norm">1.  Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have taken action pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or where they have sufficient reason to believe that a construction product covered by a harmonised standard or for which a European Technical Assessment has been issued does not achieve the declared performance and presents a risk for the fulfilment of the basic requirements for construction works covered by this Regulation, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the product concerned covering the respective requirements laid down by this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities.</p>
   <p class="norm">Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authorities find that the construction product does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the product into compliance with those requirements, notably with the declared performance, or to withdraw the product from the market, or recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.</p>
   <p class="norm">The market surveillance authorities shall inform the notified body accordingly, if a notified body is involved.</p>

   <p class="norm">3.  The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the construction products concerned which that economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.</p>
   <p class="norm">4.  Where the relevant economic operator, within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, does not take adequate corrective action, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the making available of the construction product on the national market or to withdraw the construction product from that market or to recall it.</p>
   <p class="norm">The market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.</p>

   <p class="norm">7.  Where, within 15 working days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State in relation to the construction product concerned, that measure shall be deemed justified.</p>
   <p class="norm">8.  Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken without delay in respect of the construction product concerned, such as withdrawal of the product from their market.</p>

   <p class="norm">1.  Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 56(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator(s) and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not.</p>

If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.</p>
   <p class="norm">3.  Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the construction product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards as referred to in Article 56(5)(b), the Commission shall inform the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and shall bring the matter before the Committee set up pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC. That Committee shall consult with the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and deliver its opinion without delay.</p>
   <p class="norm">Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the construction product is attributed to shortcomings in the European Assessment Document or in the Specific Technical Documentation as referred to in Article 56(5)(b), the Commission shall bring the matter before the Standing Committee on Construction and subsequently adopt the appropriate measures.</p>

   <p class="norm">2.  The economic operator shall ensure that any corrective action is taken in respect of all the construction products concerned which that economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.</p>
